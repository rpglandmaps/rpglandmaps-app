# Intro
RpgLandMaps is a windows application built in unity3d to view and control 3d top down animated tabletop roleplay maps of land, villages, towns and city maps. It is for use on any tabletop roleplay games (like D&D, RuneQuest, etc thats your choice), Using a ceiling mounted projector, or table top mounted TV as secondary or duplicated screen. 

The GM/DM is able to control the main view, by pan and zoom mode or orbit views. Control the grid visibility, size and colour. Also day and night control with a random (bias controlled) lights on for building lights at night.

The maps areas of land, to facilitate encounters, adventures, and campaigns and hopefully not let players feel like they are fenced in by the map edges and thus fully immersed into the world, and understand where they are. Also each application can include sub maps (for example The Tavern, keep, tower, temple interiors), and each sub map can have save locations that can be jumped to. Control to swap objects can be pre programed in so i can build both the castle wall and breached versions.

Detail of mpas is a complex subject, that includes performance of PC, Enough detail to inspire GM/DM and players, but leave room for GM/DM to add elements by storytelling.

The maps are drawn in 3d, using either custom home brew drawn objects and or prefabs.I plan to slowly ramp up the size/detail and include such technologies as LOD and Occlusion to add performance, and add more animated items (such as wildlife, birds etc), weather controls, and sounds controlled by location

# Version Number Control
At the moment all maps on patreon page are single display without save locations and notes etc. I want to back port them but will take time. This is Version 1-0-3 and thus any map will be published with the version number prefixed to map name so you can see if the version you have downloaded is older than the offered version, and thus update.

And this github is to track any issues suggestions for this application

Many thanks
